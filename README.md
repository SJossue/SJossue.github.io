# SJossue.github.io
My personal website to showcase my achievements.

## Local preview
This is a static site. To preview locally you can open `index.html` in a browser or run a simple local server:

On macOS / Linux:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Customization
- Edit `index.html` sections and the data arrays in `js/components/projects.js` and `js/components/timeline.js` to update content.
- Replace images in the `images/` folder. Keep file names consistent or update the paths.
